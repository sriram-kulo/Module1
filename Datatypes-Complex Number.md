# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## 💻 Program
Add Code Here
```
a=int(input()) 

b=int(input()) 

x=complex(a,b) 

print(x) 

print(x.real) 

print(x.imag) 
```

## Output
<img width="714" height="186" alt="439812683-4dec4744-2e3a-4267-abc5-70b8b535787d" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04777fdd-6129-48dc-b1c6-5afdf40b286c" />

## Result
Thus the prgram has been successfully executed.
